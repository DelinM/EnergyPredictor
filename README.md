# EnergyPredictor
*Combination of a building's energy consumption data and weather information, EnergyPredictor predicts how changes in climate factors will impact your energy consumption, so that you can making the best decisions among: 1. Do nothing! 2. Spend capital for upgrade and save downstream operational cost! 3. Suffer increased operational costs due to climate factors and only spend capital when equipment not working well.*

## 0. Background & Note to my Engineering friends  
  *With the rise of tech industry, an increasing number of government agencies such as Toronto Water and York Region are considering or even starting to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve their engineering design and decision making capabilities.*
  
  *As a Professional Engineer working in engineering consulting, I notice that the consulting firms started to advertise themselves as ML/AI experts in solving the hardest engineering problems for a better future. I can confirm that it is possible that, with the help of leading consulting firms, the public sectors will be rich with ML within next 10 years. In fact, as far as I know, the most respectful engineers and managers with 15-30 years of practical experiences have been thinking and developing scenarios of where AI could be in play in traditional engineering field. The vision is crystal clear and cutting edging.*
  
  *However, I have to admit that to allow for this technical disruption comes to maturity, aside from master their own engineering specialization engineers need understand what is ML, how to use them, and most importantly, how to efficiently integrate ML into traditional engineering workflow and decision making processes. Just like process engineering or electrical engineering, ML, standalone, is a complex field. I feel lucky that as early as the winter of 2019, I started to learn coding to improve my engineering works. It has been some time and I developed extremely strong interest in coding and wanted to see how I can influence and convince more people to use it to better a traditional engineering world. I think that, if the industry has not been disrupted yet, I want to be that pusher and contributor to fuel the disruption.*
  
  *The intent of this small case study is to show what can be done using ML, and hopefully it will allow you to think outside of the engineering box. This example is related to asset management, engineering condition assessment, and engineering capital & maintenance decision making.*
