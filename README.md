# EnergyPredictor - How extreme weather and climate change affect future facility energy cost
## 0. Note to My Dear Engineering Colleagues
  *With the rise of tech industry, an increasing number of government agencies such as Toronto Water and York Region are considering or even starting to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve their engineering design and decision making capabilities.*
  
  *As a Professional Engineer working in the business of providing engineering consulting services, I notice that the consulting firms started to advertise themselves as ML/AI experts in solving the hardest engineering problems for a better future. As one of the working member in the community, I can confirm that it is possible that, with the help of leading consulting firms, the public sectors will be rich with ML within next 10 years. In fact, as far as I know, the most respectful engineers and managers with 15-30 years of practical experiences have been thinking and developing scenarios of where AI could be in play in traditional engineering field. The vision is crystal clear and cutting edging.*
  
  However, I have to admit that to allow for this technical disruption comes to maturity, engineers have to do the hard work to understand what is ML, how to use them, and most importantly, how to efficiently integrate ML into traditional engineering workflow and decision making processes. Just like process engineering or civil engineering or electrical engineering, ML, standalone, is a subject *


have almost 4 years of experience in developing automation tools and data-focused solutions for real world business and engineering problems in an consulting environment. *
