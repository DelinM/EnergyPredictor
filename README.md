# EnergyPredictor - How extreme weather and climate change affect future facility energy cost

*Over the years, with the rise of tech industry, an increasing number of government agencies such as Toronto Water and York Region are considering or even starting to use machine learning and artificial intelligence to improve their engineering design and decision making capabilities. As a Professional Engineer and a project manager working in the business of providing engineering consulting services, I notice that the consulting firms started to advertise themselves as ML/AI experts in solving the hardest engineering problems for a better future. As one of the working member in the community, I can confirm that it is possible that, with the help of leading consulting firms, the public sector will be rich with ML within next 10 years. In fact, as far as I know, most respectful engineers with 20-30 years of practice experiences have been thinking and developing scenarios of where AI could be in play in the field of public sector, water and wastewater to be specific. But I have to admit that, we 


have almost 4 years of experience in developing automation tools and data-focused solutions for real world business and engineering problems in an consulting environment. *
